# TV shows Search Engine
This is my evaluation project for the second module of Adalab Digital Front End course. This project was done using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a web app to search for TV, getting data from an open API. It shows the results on the screen and allows you to save your favorite shows in a list by clicking on them.

If you have any doubts, questions, or ideas for improving this repository, contact me through the Issues tab!

Thanks for stopping by 👐🌈
